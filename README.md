# Triaxial Test Evaluation Tool
> With this evaluation tool you can check and interpret the results of a modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triaxial_shear_test" target="_blank">`geotechnical triaxial test`</a>. With this aperature it is possible to confine a probe, rise the axial stress and measure the permeability of the probe at all stages. The tool was developed as part of a joint project called MERID (Microstructural Influence on Reservoir Integrity at Variable Hydromechanical Conditions) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research as part of GEO:N Project ([Geoforschung f√ºr Nachhaltigkeit](https://www.bmbf.de/de/geoforschung-2398.html)) to evaluate the results of a special assembled large triaxial cell. This tool consists of a backend and a frontend both assembled in MathWorks Matlab. The backend creates a connection to a MySQL-Database where all experiments results are stored.

## Features

### Frontend (GUI)
 - List and overview all experiments in database
 - Keep rock/soil parameters always in view
 - Check experiment description and additional comments
 - Get an overview of important parameters and their connection
 - Show experiments timelog related to experiments data
 - Change integration timestep for permeability calculation
 - Plot graphs with variable x-axis and two possible y-axis
 - Compare to different/independent experiments
 - Export graphs easiely as raster graphics (1200 DPI) or vector graphics


### Backend
 - Class oriented programming in matlab
 - Connection to MySQL database
 - Interface between frontend (GUI) and MySQL database
 - Seperated classes for handling experiments meta data `ExperimentsMetaData`, meassured values `ExperimentsData`, rock/soil related data `ExperimentsSpecimenData`, MySQL database connection `MeridDB`, interface to frontend (GUI) `TriaxTestHandler`
 - Measured data cleansing like filtering NaN values
 - Calculating permeability and permeability coefficient according to fluid (water) properties with help of isantosruiz <a href="https://github.com/isantosruiz/water-properties" target="_blank">`water-properties`</a> repository.
