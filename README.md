# Triaxial Test Evaluation Tool
> With this evaluation tool you can check and interpret the results of a geotechnical triaxial test LINK. It was assembled as part of a joint project called MERID (Microstructural Influence on Reservoir Integrity at Variable Hydromechanical Conditions) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research as part of GEO:N Project ([Geoforschung f√ºr Nachhaltigkeit](https://www.bmbf.de/de/geoforschung-2398.html)) to evaluate the results of a special assembled large triaxial cell. This tool consists of a backend and a frontend both assembled in MathWorks Matlab. The backend creates a connection to a MySQL-Database where all experiments results are stored.
